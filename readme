LICENCE: I hereby grant anyone to do what they want with it apart from
Geri Halliwell and anyone who likes celery.

This is an api gui template which is tailored to suit the Marvel api.
You just need to change the field string entries to suit your api of choice.
Works with json only at present.
If you want this example to work then you need to register at marvel.com to
recieve your own keys.

-------------------------------------------------

TO USE:
1. FILL IN THE ENTRY FIELDS AND CLICK SUBMIT
The top left panel displays your main json api output

2. CLICK ON URL-CHECK BUTTON
Show urls in bottom right panel

3. CLICK ON ANY URL THEN CLICK SUBMIT URL BUTTON
Shows json output in bottom left panel

------------------------------------------------

Python code could be improved but programming is not my day job. It works though

COPY AND PASTE YOUR OWN KEYS INTO GUI ENTRY FIELDS
THESE ARE DUMMY KEYS AND WONT WORK 

addr(address field): 			https://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics
api_key(API-Key field): 		5d6a04addd6d488ef905d5e546500e9e
auth_hash(Key-Hash field):	 	7a3faf70e970082900k233faff2a857a
			
HASH IN PYTHON3 FOR MARVEL API EXAMPLE, GOES LIKE THIS md5(1+PRIVATEkey+PUBLICkey), 1 is ts=1

md5Hash = hashlib.md5("15d6a04addd6d488ef905d5e546500e9e7a3faf70e970082900k233faff2a857a".encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
print(md5Hash)

final_md5Hash = '25ee320e1649471570e7946cddb2328d'
			
THIS IS THE COMPLETE URL AFTER HASHING THAT YOU CAN TEST IN YOUR BROWSER WITH YOUR OWN KEYS

'https://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics?ts=1&apikey=5d6a04addd6d488ef905d5e546500e9e&hash=25ee320e1649471570e7946cddb2328d'
